  <span>Insurance Jobs</span>
</h2>
<p>Everyone in the insurance sector works together to provide three types of products to their customers: property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance, life insurance, and annuities. Let’s meet the people who work in the sector and their primary customers so you’re prepared to offer businesses the best solutions for their challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the Salespeople</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve ever bought insurance, you’ve met some salespeople in the insurance sector. These people are on the front lines of meeting with customers when they purchase an insurance policy.</p>

<p>Here are the three primary ways products are sold in the insurance sector.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Captive agents</strong>, also called <em>tied agents</em> or <em>exclusive agents</em>, sell products and services for one insurance company.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct sellers</strong> are employees of insurance companies that sell directly to prospective clients. Via the company's website or hotline, clients can get quotes or speak with an insurance company's sales center to ask questions and buy policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Independent agents and brokers</strong> work for their own companies, not insurers. They have relationships with multiple insurers and try to recommend insurers that best fit their clients’ needs. Right now, there’s a tremendous amount of mergers and acquisitions taking place in the independent agent and broker space. As such, insurers are working hard to maintain their relationship with independent agents and brokers by improving their service, transparency, and collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of the U.S., independent agents and brokers are often just referred to as brokers. </p>
<p><strong>Meet the Behind-the-Scenes Staff</strong></p>
<p>From sales- and administrative-focused positions to claim investigation, there are many different roles at an insurance company. Here’s a breakdown of some people you’ll run into behind the scenes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Administrative support staff</strong> schedule and coordinate between sales, support, and customers. They generally pick up tasks forwarded to them from a contact center, underwriter, or claim adjuster.</li>
  <li><strong>Claim adjusters and investigators</strong> determine how much damage actually occurred, who is at fault, and how much the policyholder pays or gets paid.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer service agents</strong> support policyholders or agents and brokers by managing payments, mailing insurance cards, or performing similar tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal wholesalers</strong> work with independent agents, financial planners, and other intermediaries to develop and grow business relationships for the insurer, expand markets, and increase sales.</li>
  <li><strong>Sales managers</strong> work with agents and brokers to help generate business for the insurance company. They create relationships with agents and brokers, manage policy sales, oversee sales teams, establish sales strategies, contribute to meeting sales targets, promote account retention, and boost agency and account growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Underwriters</strong> determine whether or not to approve an application for insurance and decide how to price the policy. They analyze insurance application risks; determine policy terms; and calculate premiums on the basis of actuarial, statistical, and background information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Meet the Leadership</strong></p>
<p>The leadership of businesses in the insurance sector is pretty similar to that of most businesses. Here are some roles that are unique to the sector:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Agency principals</strong> have ownership interest in an independent agency and may be involved in selling insurance. They usually work at medium- to smaller-sized companies.</li>
  <li><strong>Agents</strong> primarily have selling responsibility for the agency. They also usually work for medium- to smaller-sized companies.</li>
  <li><strong>Chief claims officers</strong> are responsible for setting up and maintaining programs to manage claims. People in this role sometimes review complex or high-value claims.</li>
  <li><strong>Chief digital officers</strong> develop the company’s digital innovation strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Chief experience officers</strong> serve as customer ambassadors. They build customer loyalty and advocacy by delivering positive brand experiences.</li>
  <li><strong>Marketing leaders</strong> strategize and implement marketing campaigns for insurance companies, which promotes lead generation and conversion.</li>
  <li><strong>Product leaders</strong> manage insurance product development and bring products to market. They guide team operations, monitor and communicate market trends, and track regulatory requirements to make sure the right teams have the tools they need to build successful products.</li>
  <li><strong>Sales leaders</strong> have teams in the field working with exclusive agents, independent agents, and life advisors.</li>
</ul>

<p>No matter the role, the leadership of a business in the insurance sector thinks about the future of its company and how to best address changes due to new and emerging technologies.</p>
<h2 id="the-customers">
  <span>The Customers</span>
</h2>
<p>Pretty much anyone can be a customer of the insurance sector. Insurance focuses on two main groups.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Businesses</strong> purchase insurance to cover operational risk—such as commercial property insurance to protect buildings, inventory, and equipment in the event of theft, or commercial casualty insurance to protect against injury, property damage, or negligence lawsuits—and boost employee satisfaction by offering them employee benefits, such as medical insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, and retirement plans.</li>
  <li><strong>Individuals</strong> shop for insurance and become policyholders when they purchase a policy. A person submitting a claim against the policyholder’s policy is a third-party claimant; in an auto insurance claim, this is the person in the other car.</li>
</ul>
<p>You now have a grasp of the main roles and customers in the insurance sector. Next up, recognize the trends impacting the insurance sector and how they create opportunities for Salesforce.</p>
