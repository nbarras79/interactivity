</h2>
<p>Over the past 10 years, a number of trends have shaped the challenges facing the insurance sector. They’ve brought about dramatic changes, creating tremendous opportunities for Salesforce. Let’s understand these trends and explore ways to discuss them with your prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Disasters</strong></p>
<p>The frequency and severity of natural disasters are increasing. To take their impact into account, insurers have had to adjust their pricing and underwriting. They’ve also had to work with insureds (clients) to help mitigate risks before disasters and losses occur. To make sure they’re ready to respond and support insureds before and after disasters strike, insurers have also adjusted their claims processes.</p>
<p><strong>Population Graying </strong></p>
<p>As people live longer, the proportion of retirees in the total population is going to increase. Insurers aren’t only looking to help people protect themselves today with products such as property, casualty, and life insurance; they also aim to help clients prepare for the future with products that assist with retirement and long-term care as they age.</p>
<p><strong>Retention and Recruitment</strong></p>
<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, cited in <em>The America Works Report: Industry Perspectives</em>, the number of insurance professionals aged 55 and older has increased 74% in the last 10 years, leading the bureau to estimate that 50% of the current insurance workforce will retire over the next 15 years.</p>
<p>As insurance professionals continue to retire at record numbers, insurance companies must search for new ways to attract tech-forward talent. They need to create career paths that emphasize technology and innovation to appeal to those looking to build on their skills.</p>
<p><strong>Outdated Systems</strong></p>
<p>And of course, like all sectors, the insurance sector faces the challenge of legacy systems built around the business process that are not focused on the needs of the customer. <em>Systems of record</em> store all claim, policyholder, support, and other information in different silos; this prevents companies from providing great customer experiences. </p>
<p><strong>Client Expectations</strong></p>
<p>Historically, positive client expectations have revolved around quality service and fair pricing. However, modern clients have much higher expectations. Much like agents and brokers, clients wonder why processes are so manual and time-consuming when technology and on-demand services are available in other aspects of their lives, from banking online to changing flights from their phones. Why can’t policies and bill management be as easy as lifting a finger and clicking a button? Client expectations are continuing to rise as they compare their insurance-related experiences to that of other industries, and insurers are trying hard to catch up and meet their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Journeys</strong></p>
<p>With client expectations on the rise, so too is their demand for personalization. Today’s modern client is used to receiving personalized offers and customized solutions to meet their needs. Every client wants to feel special, and they’re willing to lend a helping hand to businesses aiming to do just that. According to the <em>Accenture Global Financial Services Consumer Study</em>, 95% of new clients are willing to share their data in exchange for personalized insurance services.</p>
<p>Personalized marketing is the practice of sending clients targeted messages, offers, and recommended solutions when they need it—and it’s the future of insurance. Done well, personalized marketing results in deeper customer relationships and new opportunities.</p>
<p>For example, auto insurance may use customer data from telematic devices—which are used to monitor a car’s location, a driver’s behavior, and vehicle activity—to better estimate risks and offer targeted rates to policyholders based on how safely they drive.</p>
<p>To meet client demands, insurers need to invest in powerful data analytics to deliver the right personalized offers to their clients at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>Rise of New Technologies</strong></p>
<p>You’ve probably heard of fintechs, technology startups disrupting the financial services industry. Well, the insurance sector has a term for its technology-savvy entrants too, and they’re called <em>insurtechs</em>.</p>
<p>The technology that insurtechs use varies. Some compete with traditional insurers, while others partner with them to help them run more efficiently. Here are just a few ways they’re disrupting the market.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They use data from connected cars and wearables to create more tailored products, policies, and programs.</li>
  <li>They consolidate disparate policies and processes into a single, easy-to-use platform, like mobile apps.</li>
  <li>They harness artificial intelligence (AI) to automate tasks insurance brokers would normally complete manually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these innovations, insurers are having to evolve their traditional business models to keep pace.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Cost Reduction</strong></p>
<p>These days, nearly all insurance companies are looking for ways to save money. To offer competitive pricing to their clients, insurance companies are focused on finding ways to automate repetitive tasks, replace expensive legacy systems, reduce administrative costs, and think with a digital mindset. Simple changes—such as going paperless, streamlining online applications, and accepting electronic signatures—quickly add up to noticeable savings.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Exposure</strong></p>
<p>As businesses continue to grow online, so too will their need for robust cybersecurity measures. In this internet-based society, cybersecurity has become a key risk management practice and insurance product that insurers are bringing to market to protect businesses against financial losses caused by cybersecurity issues, such as data breaches and malware infection.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact of COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>For years now, the insurance sector has been inching toward end-to-end digitization. First, financial institutions began digitizing upfront processes to meet the evolving expectations of today’s modern customer.</p>
<p>Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and its social distancing requirements drove the rapid adoption of digital functionality that would allow policyholders to go through the entire insurance buying and self-servicing process from the safety of their homes. Loan forgiveness and mortgage relief programs were also introduced to assist those who had lost their jobs, had been laid off, or had their hours cut.</p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, the industry as a whole was forced to confront the legacy issues and manual workarounds that have been in place for years. Online options provided more access and choices to policyholders who hadn’t been able to visit insurance companies due to the shutdowns of physical buildings and offices. High-volume insurance claims have also skyrocketed during the pandemic, many of which were processed digitally through a web portal or app to deflect call volumes at contact centers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, policyholders have started to demand enhanced speed, greater convenience, and security from their insurance providers. With the move to a more virtual workforce becoming more permanent, insurers are working to support this new environment while dealing with the older systems that can’t be replaced or upgraded easily.</p>
<p>Salesforce is well positioned to help insurers adopt solutions to these challenges into their organization.</p>
