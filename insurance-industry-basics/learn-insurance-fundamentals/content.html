  <span>The Big Five of Financial Services</span>
</h2>
<p>Financial services is one of the largest sectors in the modern economy. It includes five major sectors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Banking</strong> lends, holds, and invests money.</li>
  <li><strong>Insurance</strong> shares risk among a group of people.</li>
  <li><strong>Wealth and asset management</strong> assists people in growing and protecting their wealth.</li>
  <li><strong>Investment banking</strong> assists people, corporations, and governments with investments.</li>
  <li><strong>Mortgage lending and servicing</strong> provide services to assist people when purchasing homes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, let’s learn the ins and outs of the insurance sector, speak their lingo, earn their trust, and solve their challenges so you’re ready to expand your business.</p>

  <span>Big Business Since Ancient Times</span>
</h2>
<p>People have been working together to minimize risk throughout human history. In the first millennium B.C., Rhodes merchants contributed to a shared pool of money to reimburse those who lost their merchandise. Over time, the effort to minimize risk led to the formation of the insurance sector, which now offers a wide selection of products.</p>
<p>You know what this means? The insurance sector is big business.</p>
<p>So how does the giant insurance sector make money? It follows a simple, four-step process:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Collect</strong> money, called <em>premiums</em>, when the insurance companies sell policies. Policies are legal contracts that bind the insurance company to protect the person buying the policy, or <em>policyholder</em>, when something goes wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Invest</strong> a portion of these premiums.</li>
  <li><strong>Pay</strong> the policyholder when something bad happens.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep</strong> the difference between what the insurance companies paid to the policyholder and income from the premiums and investments.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process provides peace of mind to policyholders and revenue to insurance companies; it’s a win-win for everyone.</p>

  <span>Protecting Against Risk</span>
</h2>
<p>Facing risk is a part of life, and we take steps to minimize it. Many of us have property insurance that covers damage and losses caused by fire. Those who own businesses have general liability insurance to protect them from common business risks like customer injury.</p>
<p>In the U.S., insurance companies are primarily regulated at the state level, while global insurance groups must comply with the laws, regulations, and guidelines set forth by the jurisdictions in which they operate. For more information on the role of compliance and regulation in financial services, check out the <em>Compliance and Regulation Basics</em> module.</p>
<p>To protect people against risk, the insurance sector provides services in four main areas: property and casualty (P&amp;C), life, annuities, and reinsurance. Let’s define each service area.</p>
<p><strong>Property and Casualty</strong></p>
<p>Property insurance is used when personal belongings get stolen or damaged, such as in a house fire. Casualty insurance covers policyholders in the event they cause injuries to another person or damage to someone else’s belongings, such as in an auto accident. It reduces or eliminates the financial impact on the policyholder. This type of insurance is offered to two main customer groups, often called <em>lines</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal lines</strong> provide policies and services to individuals to cover losses to their homes, rented properties, and vehicles, such as cars, boats, and recreational vehicles (RVs). Coverage also spans losses from identity theft, floods, personal liabilities, or pet liabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Commercial lines</strong> provide policies and services to businesses. Coverage spans employee injuries, auto accidents, property and liability damage, and unethical executive behavior. It’s broken into three markets based on the size of the risk: small business, mid-market, and large market. The bigger the risk, the more complicated the coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Life</strong></p>
<p>Life insurance pays money to the named beneficiaries when the covered person passes away. It provides financial security for the beneficiary’s family. There are two main types of life insurance:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Term life</strong> provides life insurance for a specified period of time, and it doesn’t build cash value.</li>
  <li><strong>Permanent life </strong>provides insurance for the covered person’s entire life. It includes the following insurance types:<ul>
      <li><strong>Whole life</strong> premiums are fixed and guaranteed to never rise. Whole life also builds a cash value, which policyholders can draw or borrow from.</li>
      <li><strong>Universal life</strong> death benefits and cash value growth aren't guaranteed. In exchange, policyholders have the flexibility to adjust their premiums and death benefits.</li>
      <li><strong>Variable life</strong> works similarly to mutual funds. While policyholders have the potential to earn more money by investing cash value in the market, they also run the risk of losing money due to poor investments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Annuities</strong></p>
<p>Annuities pay money to the policyholders after a certain period or for the rest of their lives. They’re generally used to provide income to people during retirement. Here are the main types of annuities.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fixed annuities</strong>—Policyholders provide money up front and get a fixed amount each month.</li>
  <li><strong>Fixed Indexed annuities</strong>—Policyholders provide money up front, and their earnings are based on the performance of a benchmark stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, and NASDAQ. While policyholders can’t lose more than a certain percentage on an annual basis, their earnings are normally capped.</li>
  <li><strong>Variable annuities</strong>—Policyholders provide money up front and get an amount that changes depending on the type of product selected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reinsurance</strong></p>
<p>When insurers want to reduce the risk they assume from the policies they sell, they buy reinsurance, which is insurance for insurance companies. Reinsurance minimizes the losses an insurance company experiences due to catastrophes, such as major wildfires or hurricanes in highly populated areas. In these cases, multiple insurers share the burden, making costs easier to absorb.</p>
<p>These groups make up the majority of the different types of insurance sold. Knowing them helps you engage with your prospect while speaking their language.</p>
