    <question>An Einstein Analytics consultant is working on a dataset where row-level security needs to be implemented.<br><br>How can the user accomplish this?</question>
    <option1text>Define a security predicate, turn on sharing inheritance, or do both.</option1text>
    <option1textexplanation>Correct. To restrict access to records, you can implement row-level security on a dataset when you use sharing inheritance and security predicates.</option1textexplanation>
    <option2text>Enable field-level security on a dataset.</option2text>
    <option2textexplanation>Incorrect. Field-level security does not implement row-level security on a dataset. </option2textexplanation>
    <option3text>Adjust the user’s profile to determine row-level security on a dataset.</option3text>
    <option3textexplanation>Incorrect. Adjusting the user’s profile affects all users with that profile and does not determine row-level security on a dataset.</option3textexplanation>
    <option4text>Create a permission set to enable row-level sharing on a dataset.</option4text>
    <option4textexplanation>Incorrect. Permission sets do not enable row-level sharing on a dataset in Einstein Analytics. </option4textexplanation>

  <question2>
    <accessibility>Question 2. This question has 4 possible answer(s) to chose from. The question has 1 correct answer(s).</accessibility>
    <question>An Einstein Analytics consultant wants to restrict row-level access within the dataset to only users who own the specific records.<br><br>How can a user achieve this through a security predicate? </question>
    <option1text>'Record.Id' == "$User.Id"</option1text>
    <option1textexplanation>Incorrect. Record.Id is not the correct field to use. </option1textexplanation>
    <option2text>'UserId' == "$User.Id"</option2text>
    <option2textexplanation>Incorrect. UserId is not the correct field to use.</option2textexplanation>
    <option3text>'OwnerId' == "$User.Id" </option3text>
    <option3textexplanation>Correct. OwnerId refers to the dataset column that contains the user ID of the owner of the record. While $User.Id refers to the Id column of the User object. </option3textexplanation>
    <option4text>'User.Id' == "$Role.Id"</option4text>
    <option4textexplanation>Incorrect. Role.Id is not the correct field to use. </option4textexplanation>
